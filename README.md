This Java program generates a "butterfly" pattern of stars, which is a symmetrical design that looks like a butterfly when printed in the console. Here is a breakdown of how the program works:

Explanation of the Code:
Function butterfly(int n):

The function butterfly(int n) generates the butterfly pattern for a given integer n, which determines the size of the pattern.
1st Half (Upper Part of the Butterfly):

The first for loop (for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++)) is responsible for printing the upper part of the butterfly.
It prints left stars (for (int j = 1; j <= i; j++)).
Then, it prints spaces in the middle (for (int j = 1; j <= 2 * (n - i); j++)).
Finally, it prints right stars (for (int j = 1; j <= i; j++)).
2nd Half (Lower Part of the Butterfly):

The second for loop (for (int i = n; i >= 1; i--)) is responsible for printing the lower part of the butterfly.
It prints left stars (for (int j = 1; j <= i; j++)).
Then, it prints spaces in the middle (for (int j = 1; j <= 2 * (n - i); j++)).
Finally, it prints right stars (for (int j = 1; j <= i; j++)).
Main Method:

The main method calls the butterfly function with n = 5 to print the pattern.
